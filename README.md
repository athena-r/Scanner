# Scanner

First ORT/Avantus project
Given a file (executable, text, etc) compare it to a dictionary of forbidden words using each encoding, return results
Goal: ensure code isn't sent out with any identifying information

## Notes
This is the most recent version of the program. It checks all known encodings. 
Program files include the program itself, forbidden words dictionary, a test file with several known bad words, and a pytest file
